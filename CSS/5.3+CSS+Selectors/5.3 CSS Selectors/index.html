<!--
element selector: h1
(when you select an element, you can use the tag name directly in CSS)

class selector: .name_of_the_class
(when you select a class, you use a dot followed by the class name)
(class is what we can add as an attribute to an element in HTML)

<h2 class="red-text">This is a heading</h2>
.red-text {
  color: red;
}
  doesn't matter the element, as long as it has the class "red-text", it will be red

id selector: #name_of_the_id
(when you select an id, you use a hash followed by the id name)
<h2 id="main">
  #main{
    color: blue;
  }
    
class selector can be applied to multiple elements, but id selector can only be applied to one element

attribute selector: p[draggable]{
  color: green;
}
html_element[attribute="value"]{
  color: green;
}

universal selector: *
(when you select all elements, you use an asterisk)
